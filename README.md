# Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course (Stanford University)

This repository contains my code and exercises from the **Machine Learning** course by Professor Andrew Ng, offered by **Stanford University** on Coursera. The course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, data mining, and statistical pattern recognition.

## Course Overview

The course covers the following major topics:

- **Supervised Learning**: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and more.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, Anomaly Detection.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Markov Decision Processes, Q-Learning.
- **Bias/Variance Tradeoff**: Regularization techniques to mitigate overfitting.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Gradient Descent, Conjugate Gradient, and Advanced Optimization.
- **Machine Learning Applications**: Practical applications in fields such as computer vision, medical diagnostics, and recommendation systems.

## Tools and Languages

The primary programming language used in the course is **Octave** or **MATLAB** for implementing algorithms. Some solutions might be converted into Python for modern practices.

- **Octave**: A high-level programming language primarily used for numerical computations.
- **Python**: For additional exploration and implementation of course exercises.
